      <description>Problem This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
Investigation DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer based in İstanbul, Turkey. I have a Computer Science and Engineering Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree from Sabancı University and a Software Engineering Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
I started my career as a prototyping engineer working on various cool gadgets; car consoles, video game controllers, hand tracking systems, geospatial databases and even smart fabrics. Then I switched to mobile development and worked for a very cool startup called Fleksy in San Francisco.</description>

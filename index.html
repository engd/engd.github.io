        <p>I design and develop software to fund traveling, comic books and coffee.Enjoy building products that are used everyday and working in small teams of smart, communicative people. Oh, also ice cream.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Moved to Bay Area, California in 2010 to get a Master's Degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Software Engineering. Joined SAP Labs, Palo Alto prototyping team after graduation to work on cloud infrastructures and geo-location applications for 2 years. Worked for <a href="https://www.fleksy.com">Fleksy</a>, San Francisco with a group of amazing people between November 2013 and March 2016. I spent most of my time working on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Fleksy">Fleksy Android apps</a> and was also responsible of Fleksy Cloud, a cloud backend that syncs user specific information across various Android stores. Having many toys around was one of the greatest benefits of working in an innovative startup. We had all kinds of game pads, gesture detection systems and wearables lying around the office and every now then I tried to build something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enVsFl9Lu3U">cool</a> with them.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I am looking for the next exiting thing to build/</p>

<p>I adore meticulously designed and well documented APIs and try to improve my design skills with personal projects. There is no better gift than a beautiful API for a developer.</p>

<p>Enjoy snowboarding, traveling and a sunny afternoon. Always on the lookout to improve my taste in music and photography.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5894566/engin_dogusoy_resume.pdf">resume</a> here. Beware, it is boring as many others.</p>

<p>I write about software (in English) and about geek stuff (in Turkish) on <a href="https://medium.com/@engind">Medium</a></p>

<p>You know a great book about API design? Have a project in mind you want to talk about? Know a great comic book series? Please <a href="mailto:engin.dogusoy@gmail.com">send me</a> an email.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

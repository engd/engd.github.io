        </h3>

          <p>Born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Moved to Bay Area, California in 2010 to get a Master's Degree from Carnegie Mellon University
          in Software Engineering. Joined SAP Labs, Palo Alto prototyping team after graduation to work on cloud infrastructures and geo-location
          applications for 2 years. Worked for <a href="https://www.fleksy.com">Fleksy</a>, San Francisco between November 2013 and March 2016.
          Worked on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Fleksy">Fleksy Android apps</a> and built Fleksy Cloud, a cloud backend
          that syncs user specific information across various Android stores. Every now then I tried to build
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enVsFl9Lu3U">cool things</a> with Fleksy tech.</p>

          <p>I like working in small, communicative, productive teams. Nowadays I am particularly focused on Android development
            and always on the lookout for new development tools, best practices and design patterns. In addition to writing client side Android
            code, I also enjoy developing and maintaining the backend, particularly on AWS. I keep myself updated at all times about AWS
            services and design, develop and deploy custom mobile backend solutions on AWS for my projects.

          <p>2017 areas of interest: Data mining, IoT applications, progressive web applications, chatbots.</p>
          <p>2017 tools of interest: Firebase, Gradle, CircleCI</p>

          <p>You know a great book about API design? Have a project in mind you want to talk about? Please send me an email.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

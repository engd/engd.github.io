        <p>I design and develop software to fund traveling, comic books and coffee.Enjoy building products that are used everyday and working in small teams of smart, communicative people. Oh, also ice cream.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Moved to Bay Area, California in 2010 to get a Master's Degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Software Engineering. Joined SAP Labs, Palo Alto prototyping team after graduation to work on cloud infrastructures and geo-location applications for 2 years. Worked for <a href="https://www.fleksy.com">Fleksy</a>, San Francisco between November 2013 and March 2016. Worked on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Fleksy">Fleksy Android apps</a> and built Fleksy Cloud, a cloud backend that syncs user specific information across various Android stores. Every now then I tried to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enVsFl9Lu3U">cool things</a> with Fleksy tech.</p>

<p>After 5.5 years in California, I am back in home town Istanbul, Turkey. Nowadays, I am looking for the next exciting thing to build.</p>

<p>I adore meticulously designed and well documented APIs and try to improve my design skills with personal projects. There is no better gift than a beautiful API for a developer.</p>

<p>Enjoy snowboarding, traveling and a sunny afternoon. Always on the lookout to improve my taste in music and photography.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5894566/engin_dogusoy_resume.pdf">resume</a> here. Beware, it is boring as many others.</p>

<p>I write about software (in English) and about geek stuff (in Turkish) on <a href="https://medium.com/@engind">Medium</a>.</p>

<p>You know a great book about API design? Have a project in mind you want to talk about? Know a great comic book series? Please <a href="mailto:engin.dogusoy@gmail.com">send me</a> an email.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Worked for [Fleksy](https://www.fleksy.com), San Francisco with a group of amazing people between November 2013 and March 2016. I spent most of my time working on [Fleksy Android apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Fleksy) and was also responsible of Fleksy Cloud, a cloud backend that syncs user specific information across various Android stores. Having many toys around was one of the greatest benefits of working in an innovative startup. We had all kinds of game pads, gesture detection systems and wearables lying around the office and every now then I tried to build something [cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enVsFl9Lu3U) with them.\r\n\r\nNowadays, I am looking for the next exiting thing to build/\r\n\r\nI adore meticulously designed and well documented APIs and try to improve my design skills with personal projects.

Always on the lookout to improve my taste in music and photography.\r\n\r\nYou can find my [resume](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5894566/engin_dogusoy_resume.pdf) here.
